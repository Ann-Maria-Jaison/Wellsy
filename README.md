## 👀 What is Wellsy?

**Wellsy** is a full-stack wellness web app built for students who are balancing grades, clubs, caffeine, and occasional existential dread.  
It lets you **track your mood, log your habits, de-stress with mini-games**, and get access to **mental & physical health resources** — all in one cozy lil' app.

> TL;DR: It's like a digital hug for your brain, but make it tech.

## 🧠 Why Build Wellsy?

Because students are expected to “have it all together” while running on coffee and 4 hours of sleep.  
**Wellsy** is here to remind you that it’s okay to pause, reflect, and take care of yourself — and do it in style.

> Built by students, for students. With love, code, and way too many browser tabs open.
