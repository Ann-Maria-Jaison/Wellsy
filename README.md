# Wellsy
Wellsy is a smart, interactive campus wellness website made for students who are trying to keep it together through lectures, exams, all-nighters, and “just one more episode.” It helps you track your mood, log your habits, play stress-busting games, and connect with mental &amp; physical health resources—all in a smooth, no-pressure kind of way.
