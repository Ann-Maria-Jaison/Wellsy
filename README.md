## 👋 What is Wellsy?

**Wellsy** is your digital wellness sidekick for campus life.  
It’s a web app where students can **track moods, log habits, reflect, de-stress, and actually breathe** — all from a clean, no-judgment zone.  

From late-night grinds to early morning existential crises, Wellsy is here to help you manage it all without burning out your brain or your browser.

> Think of it like a habit tracker + therapy dog + mini-game arcade. But online. And coded with love.
